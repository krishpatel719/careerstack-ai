"""Monthly call counter for quota-limited job sources.

JSearch's free tier is 200 calls a month and RapidAPI returns no usable
remaining-quota header on this plan, so consumption is tracked locally:
every call is counted, the count resets on the 1st, and the source stops
itself before the tier runs out.

Persisted through app/store.py like everything else -- one JSON document
per source per month, so last month's usage stays readable rather than
being overwritten.
