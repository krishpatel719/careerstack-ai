"""JSearch (RapidAPI) adapter.

The one source that returns full job descriptions rather than a truncated
snippet, which is why it outranks the others in dedupe (see
base.SOURCE_PRIORITY). That matters directly: discovery's per-posting
keyword score is computed over the description text, and Adzuna's ~500
character cut-off is what forced the coverage-confidence damping in the
first place.

Two guards keep this inside a 200 call/month free tier:

1. One call per role/location, never per generated query variant.
   num_pages=2 buys ~20 results for the cost of a single call.
2. A local monthly counter (see quota.py). At MONTHLY_CALL_BUDGET the
   source stops itself, keeping a reserve back for the demo -- RapidAPI's
   free plan returns no usable remaining-quota header, so this is tracked
   on our side or not at all.

Without settings.rapidapi_key this returns [] for every call and warns
once, making no HTTP request. It never raises: discovery must still run on
the other sources.
