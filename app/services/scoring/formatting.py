"""Format compliance scoring: deterministic checks only, no network, cannot
fail in a demo. This is why it's built first among the scoring components
(see CLAUDE.md's build order).

Nine checks, each with its own point value, totalling 100 when every check
applies. A tenth check (no_header_footer) was cut: text_in_header_footer
always returns False on a single-page resume (see layout.py), so it could
never fail in practice -- its 8 points were redistributed, +4 each to
no_tables and single_column, which are the two checks that keep doing real
work against real bad fixtures (demo_before.pdf has a genuine ruled skills
grid and a genuine two-column layout).

reasonable_length is not applicable for DOCX input, since text_extract.py
doesn't compute a page count for DOCX -- see _check_reasonable_length.
The table and column checks are likewise unavailable because DOCX layout
is not inspected. All three checks' 40 points are dropped from
points_possible rather than scored as passes or failures, so a DOCX resume
is scored out of 60, not given unearned points for unmeasured properties.
