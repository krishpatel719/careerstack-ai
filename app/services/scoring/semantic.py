"""Semantic fit: how well a resume's actual wording matches what a role's
requirement sentences are asking for.

PER-REQUIREMENT, not whole-document. Whole-document cosine similarity is
deliberately not used: two long technical documents tend to land around
~0.7 similarity regardless of real fit, which destroys the signal. Instead,
for each requirement sentence we find its single best-matching resume line
and average those best-match scores -- a resume only needs to say the
right thing somewhere, not read similarly to the whole posting.
