"""Tests for the combined ATS score and action plan in ats.py.

The ParsedResume and role_profile below are hand-constructed rather than
produced via parse_resume() (Groq) or mine_role_profile() (Adzuna): the
point of these tests is ats.py's own arithmetic, not the LLM or the live
job market, and a hand-built fixture keeps that arithmetic deterministic
and network-free. resume_text and layout are the real, locally-extracted
demo_before.pdf output (extract_text/layout_signals are pure local PDF
processing -- no network, no LLM), so format_score and semantic_score are
still exercised against genuine data.
