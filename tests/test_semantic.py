"""Tests for per-requirement semantic fit in semantic.py.

The model-backed tests use the real MiniLM model (cached locally after the
first run) rather than a mock, since the whole point of these checks is
the per-requirement max-then-average behaviour and the calibration curve,
not just that some function got called. They assert on thresholds and
relative ordering rather than exact cosine floats, since embedding values
can shift by tiny amounts across hardware/BLAS backends.

    Backend developer with experience building REST APIs in Python and Django.

    EXPERIENCE
    - Built and documented REST API endpoints in Django REST Framework for the internal analytics dashboard.
    - Optimised slow PostgreSQL queries by adding composite indexes to speed up dashboard load time.
    - Containerised the local development environment with Docker Compose for faster onboarding.
    - Wrote pytest unit tests and wired them into the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
    - Collaborated with product and infrastructure engineers on a two-week sprint cadence.
